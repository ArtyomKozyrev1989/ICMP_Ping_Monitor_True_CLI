# ICMP_Ping_Monitor_True_CLI
The program is created to ping several ip addresses, put results in separate txt files, distribute files between folders, send email if ip is not reachable, send email if ip is reachable again. All action are independent for each ip address.

The program has TRUE CLI, which is similar to CMD or router CLI. The CLI is based on subprocess.Popen class.

Note that the program can be used only in Windows OS now, but you can do some changes to try to use it in your OS.

Feel free to ask questions and give remommendations. Feel free to use the code in your projects or to to learn from.

The program is not the final version, I'm going to add new changes in future, new contributors are welcome.
